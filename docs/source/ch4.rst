Citations
---------

.. [11] This is the citation I made, let's make this extremely long so that we can tell that it doesn't follow the normal responsive table stuff.

.. [12] This citation has some ``code blocks`` in it, maybe some **bold** and
       *italics* too. Heck, lets put a link to a meta citation [13]_ too.

.. [13] This citation will have two backlinks.


Here's a reference to the above, [12]_, and a [nonexistent]_ citation.
